# Log Analysis & Incident Report (In Progress)
A Python-based log analysis and incident response simulation project exploring detection and reporting of security events.

## Overview
This project simulates an incident response exercise by parsing system logs to identify suspicious events such as failed login attempts, privilege escalation, or unusual access activity. Findings are summarized in a professional incident report format.

## Goals
- Build and refine a Python log parsing script.
- Identify patterns in authentication logs (failed vs successful attempts).
- Generate a findings report with remediation recommendations.

## Current Status
Project setup complete. Log samples and parser design in progress.  
Expected next update: November 30, 2025.

## Tools & Skills
- Python 3
- Regex, log parsing
- Incident reporting
- NIST Incident Response framework

## Disclaimer
All log data is simulated and used for educational purposes only.
